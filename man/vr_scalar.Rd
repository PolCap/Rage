\arguments{
\item{matU}{The survival component of a matrix population model (i.e. a
square projection matrix reflecting survival-related transitions; e.g.
progression, stasis, and retrogression)}

\item{posU}{A logical matrix of the same dimension as \code{matU}, with
elements indicating whether a given \code{matU} transition is possible
(\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}). Defaults to \code{matU > 0} (see
Details).}

\item{weights_col}{Vector of stage-specific weights to apply while averaging
vital rates across columns. See section \emph{Weighting}.}

\item{exclude_col}{Integer or logical vector indicating stages for which
transitions \emph{from} the stage should be ignore (coerced to \code{NA}).
See section \emph{Excluding stages}.}

\item{exclude_row}{Integer or logical vector indicating stages for which
transitions \emph{to} the stage should be excluded from the calculation of
vital rates. See section 'Excluding stages'.}

\item{surv_only_na}{If there is only one possible \code{matU} transition in a
given column, should that transition be attributed exclusively to survival?
If \code{TRUE}, the vital rate of growth/stasis/shrinkage in that column
will be coerced to \code{NA}. If \code{FALSE}, dividing the single
transition by the stage-specific survival probability will always yield a
value of \code{1}. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{dorm_stages}{Integer indicator(s) for dormant stage classes.}

\item{matR}{The reproductive component of a matrix population model (i.e. a
square projection matrix reflecting transitions due to reproduction; either
sexual, clonal, or both)}

\item{posR}{A logical matrix of the same dimension as \code{matR}, with
elements indicating whether a given \code{matR} transition is possible
(\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}). Defaults to \code{matR > 0} (see
Details).}

\item{weights_row}{Vector of stage-specific weights to apply while averaging
vital rates across rows within columns. See section \emph{Weighting}.}
}
\value{
Vector of vital rates. Vital rates corrsponding to impossible
  transitions will be coerced to \code{NA} (see Details).
}
\description{
Derive stage-specific vital rates from a matrix population model. Available
vital rates include survival, and a variety of traits that are conditional on
survival including growth, shrinkage, stasis, entering and exiting dormancy,
and reproduction. Vital rates corresponding to impossible transitions are
coerced to \code{NA}.

With one exception, these functions assume that transition rates in the
matrix population model were in fact calculated as the product of
stage-specific survival values and lower-level vital rates of growth, stasis,
shrinkage, and reproduction. The one exception is that, if a matrix
population model has non-zero reproduction in a stage from which there is no
survival, \code{vr_scalar_fecund} will return the full reproductive transition
as the vital rate (i.e. because there is no survival component to pull out).
}
\details{
A transition rate of \code{0} within a matrix population model may indicate
that the transition is not possible in the given life cycle (e.g. tadpoles
never revert to eggs), or that the transition rate is possible but was
estimated to be \code{0} in the relevant population and time period. If vital
rates are to be averaged across multiple stage classes, or compared across
populations, it may be important to distinguish between these two types of
zeros.

By default, the \code{vr_scalar_} functions assume that a transition rate of
\code{0} indicates an impossible transition, in which case a value of
\code{NA} will be used in relevant calculations. Specifically, the arguments
\code{posU} and \code{posR} are specified by the logical expressions
\code{(matU > 0)} and \code{(matR > 0)}, respectively. If the matrix
population model includes transitions that are estimated to be \code{0} but
still in fact possible, one should specify the \code{posU} and/or \code{posR}
arguments manually.
