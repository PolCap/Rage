\title{Splits a matrix population model into the constituent U, F and C matrices}
\usage{
splitMatrix(matA)
}
\arguments{
\item{matA}{A matrix population model}
}
\value{
A list of three matrices: \code{matU},\code{matF} and \code{matC}
}
\description{
This function splits a matrix population model into three constituent
matrices, U (growth and survival processes), F (sexual reproduction) and C
(clonal reproduction). Warning! The functionality is very basic â€” it assumes
that sexual reproduction is located in the top row of the matrix, and that
everything else is growth or survival (the U matrix). Clonality is assumed to
be non-existant.

\examples{
matA <- rbind(c(0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 1.3),
              c(0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0),
              c(0.0, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0),
              c(0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.1))
